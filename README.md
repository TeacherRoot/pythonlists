# Value occurs more than once

Lab Description :   Write a program that will search through a list to see if the last value in the list occurs more than once.  If the last value occurs more than once, return true.  Otherwise, return false.  If the list is empty, return false.


Sample Data
[-99,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,5]


Sample Output
True

# Search a list
Lab Description :   Write a program that will search a list to see to see which value occurs the least number of times.   There will be only one least value.


Sample Data
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]
	
Sample Output
4

# Average minus lowest
Lab Description :   Write a program that will determine the average of all numbers in the list, dropping the lowest value.

Sample Data 
[-99,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12345]


Sample Output
1033.3333333333333
